Feature: Assert an element is displayed or not displayed
  In order to ensure an element is displayed
  As a developer
  I should be able to assert an element is displayed

  Background:
    Given I am on "/ScrollableDivs.html"

  Scenario: Assert visibility status of test elements
    Then "Big DIV" should be partially visible in the viewport
     And "All Centered 1" should be fully visible in the viewport
     And "All Centered 2" should be fully visible in the viewport
     And "All Centered 3" should be fully visible in the viewport
     And "All Centered 4" should be fully visible in the viewport

     And "Partial Left" should be partially visible in the viewport
     And "Partial Right" should be partially visible in the viewport
     And "Partial Top" should be partially visible in the viewport
     And "Partial Bottom" should be partially visible in the viewport

     And "Out to left" should not be visible in the viewport
     And "Out to right" should not be visible in the viewport
     And "Out to top" should not be visible in the viewport
     And "Out to bottom" should not be visible in the viewport

     And "Visible" should be fully visible in the viewport
     And "Invisible" should not be visible in the viewport
     And "Invisible 2" should not be visible in the viewport
     And "Visible 2" should not be visible in the viewport

  Scenario Outline: Throw a ExpectationException when visibility test fails
    When I assert that <Step Text to Assert>
    Then the assertion should throw a ExpectationException
    And the assertion should fail with the message "<Expected Exception Message>"

    Examples:
      | Step Text to Assert                                          | Expected Exception Message                               |
