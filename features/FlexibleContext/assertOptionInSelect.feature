Feature:  Assert Option in Select
  In order to ensure that select elements behave as expected
  As a developer
  I should have select behavior assertions

  Background:
    Given I am on "/select-option.html"

  Scenario: Developer can assert select has matching options
    Then the "Country" select should only have the following options:
      | US     |
      | China  |
      | Canada |

  Scenario: Assertion fails reliably if select has the same options but in the wrong order
    When I assert that the "Country" select should only have the following options:
      | China  |
      | Canada |
      | US     |
    Then the assertion should throw an ExpectationException
     And the assertion should fail with the message "Options in select match expected but not in expected order"

  Scenario: Assertion fails reliably if select has less option than expected
    When I assert that the "Country" select should only have the following options:
      | US     |
      | China  |
      | Canada |
      | Mexico |
    Then the assertion should throw an ExpectationException
     And the assertion should fail with the message "Select has less option then expected"

  Scenario: Assertion fails reliably if select has more option than expected
    When I assert that the "Country" select should only have the following options:
      | US     |
      | China  |
    Then the assertion should throw an ExpectationException
     And the assertion should fail with the message "Select has more option then expected"

  Scenario: Assertion fails reliably if select has totally different option than expected
    When I assert that the "Country" select should only have the following options:
      | US     |
      | China  |
      | French |
    Then the assertion should throw an ExpectationException
     And the assertion should fail with the message "Expecting 3 matching option(s), found 2"

  Scenario: Assertion fails reliably if select has totally different option than expected
    When I assert that the "Country" select should only have the following options:
      | Japan  |
      | German |
      | French |
    Then the assertion should throw an ExpectationException
     And the assertion should fail with the message "Expecting 3 matching option(s), found 0"

  Scenario: Assertion fails reliably if no option in the select
    When I assert that the "State" select should only have the following options:
      | Texas |
      | Ohio  |
    Then the assertion should throw an ExpectationException
     And the assertion should fail with the message "No option found in the select"

  Scenario: Assertion fails reliably if option given in the wrong format
    When I assert that the "State" select should only have the following options:
     | Texas | Ohio |
    Then the assertion should throw an InvalidArgumentException
     And the assertion should fail with the message "Arguments must be a single-column list of items"
